		<h3> Possible Solutions for this Case Study: </h3>
		
		<p>
		Cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a very complex issue with no easy fix. However there are multiple solutions that might make this situation better in the long run. First there should be some better working conditions like normal 8 hour days, PPE (Personal Protective Equipment), better pay, and some more modern mining and other safety equipment. Along with better working conditions, there should be legislation passed to better protect the people mining the cobalt. Next there should be the continued effort to develop batteries that do not require cobalt in order to function. There are already some that do not require cobalt but many still do. Finally, there should be efforts to raise awareness of this going on. The DRC and the rest of Africa seem to be fly-over country for the rest of the world. There is almost zero media coverage of this crisis taking place and there should be more people like Siddharth Kara raising awareness and more people like Joe Rogan willing to share these poeple's messages and stories about what is going on in the DRC.
